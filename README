Pod::Peapod
======================

Pod::Peapod is a base class for Pod parsers.

Pod::Peapod::Tkpeapod is a base class implementing
	a POD viewer using Tk widgets.
	(see t/peapod)

Pod::Peapod::Text is a base class implementing
	a POD to text converter.
	(see t/text)

Yes, there are other POD viewers available on CPAN,
and I recommend you use them for viewing POD.
Peapod will eventually (hopefully) support some
features that extends POD beyond its standard definition.

Stay tuned.
